** NOTE **
If you downloaded kmotion from svn you will have to ...

sudo chmod +x install.py

GoogleCode seems to have a hang up about letting 'install.py' be executable !

-----------

I have written some documentation which is hopefully usefull, its in the docs directory
in odt & PDF formats.

Let me know what you think

Cheers

Dave
