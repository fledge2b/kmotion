<div id="grovel">
Kmotion, well what can I say about it? I wrote it in my free time, It works, it has a pleasant GUI, I learned a lot programming the LAMP stack, and err .... Look I really really really want a job programming, I will work for nothing, OK not nothing but minimum wage tops,  I will work round the clock 247, I will even make tea .... JUST GIVE ME A JOB DOING WHAT I LOVE.
